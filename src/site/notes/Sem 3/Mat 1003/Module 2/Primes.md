- positive integer p>1 is called prime if the only positive factors of p are 1 and p. A positive integer that is greater than one and is not a prime is called a composite.

*Every positive integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a prime or as the product of two or more primes where the prime factors are written in order of non-decreasing size*

If **n** is a composite integer, then n has a prime divisor less than or equal to root of n
