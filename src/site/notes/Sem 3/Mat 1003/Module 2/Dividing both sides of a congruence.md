Let *m* be a positive integer and *a*, *b* and *c* be integers. If ac=bc (mod m) and gcd(c,m) = 1, then a = b(mod m).

### Linear Congruences

Let *m* be a positive integer, *a* and *b* be integers and *x* be a variable. The following congruence is called **Linear congruence**
	ax = b(mod m)

### Inverse of a(mod m)

*~a* is an inverse of *a(mod m)* if ~aa = 1(mod m) 

there exist *s* and *t* such that 
	sa+tm = 1

since tm = 0(mod m)
	sa = 1(mod m)
which implies s is an inverse of a modulo m

(use backward substitution to find inverse of a modulo m)
