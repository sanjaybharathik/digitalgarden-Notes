### Conditional Proposition
The conditional proposition is denoted by p -> q and read as "if p, then q". p -> q is false when p is true and q is false and true otherwise. In the conditional proposition p -> q, p is called the premise(or antecedent/hypothesis) and q is called the conclusion.

Eg:
	p = It is not raining outside,
	q = We will go for a movie
	p -> q = If it is not raining outside then we will go for a movie.

|p|q|p -> q|

|T|T|T|
|T|F|F|
|F|T|T|
|F|F|T|

### Biconditional Proposition
The biconditional proposition is denoted by p <-> q and read as "p if and only if q" or "p iff q". p <-> q = I an not going to college if and only if today is sunday.

|p|q|p <-> q|
