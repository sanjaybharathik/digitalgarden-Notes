### Direct Proof
Find the proof directly by finding the conclusion for the premise

### Exhaustive Proof
Some theorems can be proved by examining a relatively small number of examples. Such proofs are called exhaustive proofs, or proofs by exhaustion because these proofs proceed by exhausting all possibilities. An exhaustive proof is a special type of proof by cases where case involves checking a single example.

### Proof by Case
A proof by case must cover all possible cases that arise in a theorem. We illustrate proof by cases with a couple of example. In each example, you should check that alk possible cases are covered.
