### 1. Conjuction
Any two propositions can be combined by the work "and" to form a compound proposition called the conjunction of the original proposition.

Symbolically
	p `/\` q

Note: If p and q are true, then p `/\` q is true; otherwise p `/\` q is false.

| p | q | p `/\` q |
|----|----|-----|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | F |

Another way to define:

| p | q | p `/\` q |
|----|----|-----|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

### 2. Disjunction 
Any two propositions can ber combined by the word "or" to form a compount proposition called the disjunction of the original proposition.

Symbolically
	p `\/` q.

Note: If p and q are false, then p `\/` q is false; otherwise p `\/` q is true.

| p | q | p `\/` q |
|----|----|-----|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | F |

Another way to define:

| p | q | p `/\` q |
|----|----|-----|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

### 3. Negation
If p is true, then -p is false; and is p is false, then -p is true.
Where, -p stands for negation.

| p | -p |
|----|----|
| T | F |
| F | T |

| p | -p |
|----|----|
| 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 |
