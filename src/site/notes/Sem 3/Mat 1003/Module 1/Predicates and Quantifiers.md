### Predicates

Eg:
	Let P(x) denote x>3. What are the truth values of P(4) and P(2)?
	Sol:
		P(4) = 4>3 = True
		P(2) = 2>3 = False

### The Universal Quantifier
The universal quantification of P(x) is the statement
"P(x) for all values of x in the domain." V is the universal quantifier

### The Existential Quantifier
The existential quantification of P(x) is the proposition "There exist an element x in the domaimn such that P(x)"
The mirror E is called the existential quantifier

### Precedence of Quantifiers
The quantifiers have higher precedence than all logical operators from propositional calculus

### Logical Equivalence Involving Quantifiers
Statement involving predicates and quantifiers are logically equivalent if and only if they have the same truth value no matter which predicates are substituted into these propositions function.
