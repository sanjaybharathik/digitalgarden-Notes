# Proposition and Compound Statement
---

### Proposition
Proposition is a declarative statement which is true or false, but not both.

Eg.
	Hens lay Eggs
	2+2=11

Statements that are not Proposition
	Where are you going?
	How are you?

### Compound Statement
Many propositions are composite, that is, composed of sub-propositions and various connectives discussed subsequently. Such composite propositions are called **Compound proposition**

Eg.
	Roses are red and voilets are blue

### P.S -  True = 1 ; False = 0.
