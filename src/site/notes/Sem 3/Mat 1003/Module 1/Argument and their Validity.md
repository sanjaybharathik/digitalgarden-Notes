### Argument
Deduction of a proposition Q from a set of propositions is called an argument. It is denoted as P1,P2....Pn |- Q. Here P1,P2....Pn are called premises and Q is called conclusion

- Valid Argument: P1,P2.....Pn |- Q is called a valid argument if Q is true whenever all the premises P1,P2....Pn are true or, equivalently, if the proposition (P1`/\`P2`/\`.....`/\`Pn) -> Q is a tautology.
- Fallcy(Invalid Argument): An argument which is not valid is called a fallacy.
